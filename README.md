#### System Architecture:

1. **User Interface Layer:**
   - Contains HTML templates rendered by Flask.
   - Uses Bootstrap for responsive design and user-friendly interfaces.
   
2. **Application Layer:**
   - Flask routes handle HTTP requests and return responses.
   - Contains business logic for managing donors, inventory, and requests.

3. **Data Layer:**
   - Database models defined using SQLAlchemy (if using Flask's ORM) to interact with the database.
   - Ensures data integrity and security through proper validation and authentication mechanisms.

### Sample Use Case Scenarios:

1. **Donor Registration:**
   - A new donor visits the website, fills out the registration form, and submits it.
   - The system validates the information and saves it in the database.
   - The donor receives a confirmation email with their login credentials.

2. **Blood Request:**
   - A hospital needs a specific blood type for a patient.
   - They log in to the system, fill out the request form, and submit it.
   - The admin reviews the request and approves it if the required blood type is available.
   - The system updates the inventory and notifies the hospital.

3. **Inventory Management:**
   - An admin logs in to check the current blood stock.
   - They see that a particular blood type is running low.
   - The system sends out notifications to potential donors of that blood type, requesting donations.

### Conclusion:

A Blood Bank Management System built with Python Flask, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap offers a robust solution for managing blood donations and inventory. It enhances efficiency, ensures timely availability of blood, and improves overall management of blood banks. The system's user-friendly interface and automated features streamline operations and support the life-saving mission of blood banks.
